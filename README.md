## Working of this project
### Purpose:

The Meeting Room Booking System is designed to facilitate the efficient management and booking of meeting rooms within an organization. It aims to streamline the process of checking room availability, making reservations, and managing user roles and permissions. The system ensures that booking conflicts are avoided and provides a secure and user-friendly interface for administrators and users alike.

### Functionality:

#### User Authentication and Role Management:

- Users can sign up and log in to the system.
- Roles (e.g., 'user' and 'admin') are assigned to users, dictating their access levels and permissions.
- Secure password handling and role-based access control ensure data security and appropriate access.
#### Meeting Room Management:

- Administrators can add, update, and delete meeting rooms.
- Each room has detailed information, including location, capacity, pricePerSlot and available amenities.
#### Booking Management:

- Users can check the availability of meeting rooms in real-time.
- Users can book available meeting rooms by specifying the date, time slots, and room preferences.
- The system prevents booking conflicts by ensuring that overlapping bookings for the same room are not allowed.

#### Slot Management:

- Administrators can define and manage time slots for each meeting room.
- Time slots can be created, updated, or deleted based on the organizationâ€™s requirements.
- The system ensures that time slots are properly allocated to avoid overlaps and double bookings.
- Users can select specific time slots for their meetings during the booking process, ensuring precise scheduling.
- Only available (unbooked) slots are displayed to users, enhancing the efficiency of the booking process.

#### CRUD Operations:

- The system supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for users, rooms, and bookings.
- Users can view and manage their own bookings.
- Administrators have full control over all entities within the system.

#### Data Validation and Error Handling:

- Data validation is performed using Zod to ensure that all input data is correct and meets the required criteria.
- Custom error handling middleware manages errors gracefully, providing clear and concise error messages to the user.

#### Integration with MongoDB:

- Mongoose is used to model and interact with the MongoDB database.
- The database stores all relevant information, including user data, room details, and booking records.
- Efficient querying and data manipulation ensure quick response times and a smooth user experience.

Overall, the Meeting Room Booking System provides a comprehensive solution for managing meeting room bookings, enhancing productivity and organization within a company.
